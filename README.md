# PKI and TEE Authentication System

This project demonstrates a simple authentication system that integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with certificate-based authentication. It also includes a placeholder for integrating Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) operations to secure key management and other cryptographic operations.

## Features

- **PKI Authentication**: Utilizes RSA key pairs for secure certificate-based authentication.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Integration**: Placeholder for integrating TEE technologies (such as Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone) for secure execution.
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: Generates and uses self-signed certificates for user authentication.
- **RSA Key Pair Generation**: RSA key pairs are generated dynamically for use in the authentication process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Install the required dependencies with the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pki-tee-authentication.git
   cd pki-tee-authentication
   ```

2. Set up the Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Generate the Certificate and Keys

Run `pki_auth.py` to generate the RSA key pair and self-signed certificate. This will create the following files:

- `certificate.pem` (public certificate)
- `private_key.pem` (private key)

```bash
python pki_auth.py
```

### 2. Authenticate the User

Run `auth_system.py` to perform authentication using the generated certificate and private key.

```bash
python auth_system.py
```

### 3. (Optional) Use TEE

The `tee_auth.py` file is a placeholder for integrating TEE features such as secure key management and cryptographic operations. It doesn't currently contain a full implementation but serves as an example for integrating TEE technologies.

## Files Overview

- **`pki_auth.py`**: Contains code for generating RSA key pairs and self-signed certificates.
- **`authenticate_with_cert.py`**: Manages certificate-based authentication and signature verification.
- **`tee_auth.py`**: Placeholder for integrating Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies.
- **`auth_system.py`**: Main script to perform the authentication process using certificates and keys.
- **`certificate.pem`**: Generated public certificate.
- **`private_key.pem`**: Generated private key.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python dependencies.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

- `cryptography`: For cryptographic operations including RSA key generation and certificate creation.

Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
